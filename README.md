# CMO_NN
CMO project source codes

Include:

C++ based measurement manager

Matlab based data preprocessor

Keras based (Google Collab) neural network script


Beware:

It is highly unorganized and isn't pretty to look at. I didn't follow proper code formating, which I do later.

It also doesn't include two API and their source files as both of them are not allowed to be redistributed. The C++ part needs to be rewritten so it can run without the APIs.
